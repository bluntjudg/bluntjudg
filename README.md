### 🧠 About Me

I'm an AI & ML engineer who focuses on building intelligent systems not just models.

I work at the intersection of:
- Large Language Models
- Backend Engineering
- Automation Pipelines
- Production-Ready ML Systems

I enjoy designing AI systems that reason over data, automate workflows, and integrate into real-world business use cases.
